## Introduction

This repo talks about the creation the text summarization of using deep learing starting from neural networks to recurrent neural networks to large language models like BERT, etc.,
Each notebook follows the below format for the text summarization
Data Preparation ⟶ Feature Engineering ⟶ Model Configuration ⟶ Model Tranining ⟶ Model Evaluation
